# My Twilio Flex Plugin Template

This is a template Twilio Flex Plugin, demonstrating many of the typical coding techniques.

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com). We support Node >= 10.12 (and recommend the _even_ versions of Node). Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd 

# If you use npm
npm install
```
## Development

Find all occurrences of TODO in the code. These require some editing.
